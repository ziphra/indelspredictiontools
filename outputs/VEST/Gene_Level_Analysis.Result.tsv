#This report shows analysis results at gene level.
#The composite p-value (Stouffer's combined p-value) and composite FDR of a gene show how probable it is to get the same p-value distribution for the gene as that obtained from the input variants by chance.

MTMR3	2	MS							14	upper_aerodigestive_tract(1);ovary(2);breast(3);skin(8)	2	 This gene encodes a member of the myotubularin dual specificity protein phosphatase gene family. The encoded protein is  structurally similar to myotubularin but in addition contains a FYVE domain and an N-terminal PH-GRAM domain. The  protein can self-associate and also form heteromers with another myotubularin related protein. The protein binds to  phosphoinositide lipids through the PH-GRAM domain, and can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol(3)-phosphate and  phosphatidylinositol(3,5)-biphosphate in vitro. The encoded protein has been observed to have a perinuclear, possibly  membrane-bound, distribution in cells, but it has also been found free in the cytoplasm. Multiple transcript variants  encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein is predominantly nuclear and may help transduce signals from the  cytoskeleton to the nucleus. This gene is involved in a specific translocation event that creates a fusion of this  gene and the RNA-binding motif protein-15 gene. This translocation has been associated with acute megakaryocytic  leukemia.
